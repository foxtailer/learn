"""for built-in types like list, str, bytearray, and so on, the interpreter takes a short‚Äê
cut: the CPython implementation of len() actually returns the value of the ob_size
field in the PyVarObject C struct that represents any variable-sized built-in object in
memory. This is much faster than calling a method."""
